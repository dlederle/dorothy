<p>Douglas Hofstadter's <em>Godel, Escher, Bach: an Eternal Golden Braid</em> (GEB) is a Pulitzer Prize-winning opus on human thought and intelligence.
The central motivating question is whether or not it is possible to create Artificial Intelligence, however Hofstadter explores this question from a number of interesting angles.
Drawing on philosophy, formal mathematics, and the world of art, among others, Hofstadter weaves an impressively broad argument.
Ian Bogost's <em>Alien Phenomenology: or What It's Like to Be a Thing</em> (AP) is a more recent book, with a much narrower focus.
In it, Bogost works on developing "Object Oriented Ontology," (OOO) in which the focus of philosophical inquiry is not exclusively the concerns of humanity.
Rather, Bogost focuses on Objects, or "things", and conceives of their reality, not only as it relates to human perception.
In this paper, I bring these two texts into conversation, using JavaScript as a medium for exploring their ideas.
In particular I am focused on two chapters of GEB, <em>Brains and Thoughts</em> and <em>Minds and Thoughts</em> and their associated dialogues, <em>...Ant Fugue</em> and <em>English French German Suite</em>.</p>

<p>Bogost's AP is a work of "speculative realism", in the emerging area of Object Oriented Ontology.
The basic thesis of the book is that "all things equally exist, yet they do not exist equally" (Bogost, 11).
This tangled phrase is truly the simplist summary of the book.
OOO seeks to expand the realm of philosophy beyond humans, seeking to explore the nature and existence of all objects.
Objects in this case are not necessarily physical.
Objects are discrete units, interesting in and of themselves, which interact with other objects in a non-hierarchical manner.
These objects are not the focus of study because they form some larger object, closer to human concerns, which is the actual object of interest.
Rather, Levi Bryant terms this a <em>flat ontology</em>, in which he claims "The world does not exist."
Bogost explains that this does not mean the Earth does not exist, it means that "there is no 'super-object'...that would gather all objects together in a harmonious unity" (Bryant, qtd in Bogost,  12).</p>

<p>Hofstadter's GEB is an inherently human focussed work. 
He is focused on the creation of an Artificial Intelligence, as defined by human actors.
Bogost notes that the very question of machine's thinking "already contains the singular human-world correlate" (Bogost, 14), and tells us little to nothing about the existence of the computer.
Discussing the Turing Test, Bogost critiques the assumption that the computer's existence is defined and limited by humans.
The implicit assumption of AI research is that "to discover the true nature of computation is also to discover the true nature of human reason" (Bogost, 15).
This is precisely the project the Hofstadter undertakes.
The breathtaking breadth of GEB is still limited to humans.
Of course, an account of computational existence is not the goal of GEB, but Bogost's ideas intersect in interesting ways with Hofstadter's.
Tracing these connections can enrich understanding of both fields.</p>

<p><em>Brains and Thoughts</em> focuses on the physical materiality of the human brain, its "hardware", and explores its relationship to thought.
"Thought must depend on <em>representing reality in the hardware of the brain.</em>", Hofstadter begins (337).
Hofstadter explains that neurons are the symbols of the brain, active symbols which can store, transmit and recieve information.
Neurons form larger structures of the brain, suborgans such as the cerebrum, which Hofstadter is not particularly concerned with.
Instead, he is interested in discussing where thought occurs in the brain.
Hofstadter relates several interesting psychology studies that attempt to answer this question.
Karl Lashley, in the first half of the 20th century, ran experiments that attempted to pinpoint the location of memory in the brain by training rats and removing parts of their brain.
Weirdly, the rats continued to complete the mazes no matter which portion of the brain was removed.
Steven Rose says "Lashley concluded rather gloomily...that the only conclusion was memory was not possible at all" (Rose, qtd in Hofstadter, 342).
This inability to find the physical location of thought is challenging to our understanding of the brain as the source of thoughts.
There are several explanations given by Hofstadter, including replication of memory or a network which routes information around damaged portions of the brain.
Regardless of the true explanation, there is clearly not a simple one-to-one relationship between the physical brain and our thoughts.</p>

<p>While GEB's content is fascinating in its own right, the book is elevated by its structure.
The twenty chapters are alternated with small dialogues or scenes, featuring an array of characters, but mainly Achilles and Tortoise.
Achilles always plays the role of the naive bumbler, while Tortoise is wiser.
Together with Anteater, Crab and others, they playfully discuss the concepts which Hofstadter explores more formally in the following chapter.
These dialogues are somewhat akin to Bogost's concept of "Carpentry".
Carpentry is the creation of objects that do philosophical work.
Bogost defines it as the "practice of constructing artifacts as a philosophical practice" (Bogost, 92).
Rather than writing about philosophical arguments, which is often quite difficult to do clearly, and can easily become impenetrable, Bogost offers the alternative of Carpentry.
Carpentry is only tangentially related to the central ideas of AP, but it is a practice that I think is valuable even without buying into the stranger aspects of Object Oriented Ontology.
Now, Hofstadter's dialogues are not truly so different from more traditional written versions of philosophical argumentation, but they are clearly constructed objects, with intentional forms that convey meaning beyond the semantic message of their text.
This approaches carpentry.</p>

<p>The dialogue preceeding <em>Brains and Thoughts</em> is called the Ant Fugue, and is one of the best in the book.
In it, Achilles, Crab, Anteater, and Tortoise discuss different levels of interpetation, particularly the competing ideas of Holism and Reductionism.
Crab defines Holism as "the belief that 'the whole is greater than the sum of its parts".
Anteater defines Reductionism as "the belief that 'a whole can be understood completely if you understand its parts, and the nature of their sum'" (Hofstadter, 312).
Achilles, to diffuse the controversy, presents this alternative: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>"MU" is an ancient Zen answer which, when given to a question, UNASKS the question. Here the question seems to be "should the world be understood via holism, or via reductionism?" And the answer of "MU" here rejects the premises of the question.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>MU sounds quite a lot like Bogost's explanation of OOO.
Bogost claims both Holism and Reductionism are examples of <em>System Operations</em>, which seek a "definitive explanation" to understand being.
The two primary system operations he cited are "scientific naturalism and social relativism" (Bogost, 13).
Scientific naturalism corresponds roughly to Anteater's Reductionism, and seeks to "explain all that is" by examining the smaller Objects which comprise a thing, whether these objects are "particle physics, gentics, bran chemistry, whatever" (Bogost, 13).
Social relativism relates all things to the larger human society, and "argues that all things exist through conceptualization" (Bogost, 13).
Both of these viewpoints are human centric, and to them Bogost says "MU".</p>
