title: The making of this blog
date: 24/09/2011

Getting this blog online has been a bit of a headache. For all [these reasons], I was convinced to start blogging. After reading various disccusions surrounding Google+, I was also convinced to put it up on my own domain. I also figured it was high time I had experience running a website.

I like a lot about Ruby, including its syntax and especcially the ease of heroku. Then I found out that my mian programming class in the fall would be in Java, and heroku added Play! support.

  A week of infrequent tinkering yielded nothing buy a place holder home page. No disqus comments, no rss, no beautiful layout. Having blown two blog deadlines for my senior seminar, I broke down and did a 10 second toto install, which I should have done in the first place.
  Right now, I'm running blog.dlederle.com as a toto app on heroku and dlederle.com as a Play! app also on heroku. I bet this violates some design principle, but until I learn why I'm gonna
