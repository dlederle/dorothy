Hacktivist Games

Activism and the Internet have been in the news a lot this spring, and their intersection with gaming has been <a href="http://playthisthing.com/tahrir-game" target="_blank">discussed in certain circles</a>. I began my own attempt at exploring the <a href="http://gamedesign.umwblogs.org/2011/03/06/jan25-postmortem/" target="_blank">revolution in Egypt</a> through a game. In the course of research for that game, I read a post on the<a href="http://blog.strongmangames.co.uk/post/2359054606/hacktivist-games"> Strongman Games blog</a> exploring the author's response to Wikileaks and newsgaming. The post concluded by proposing a new genre of games, hacktivist games, in which the games' procedural rhetoric is carried out onto the world directly. I disagree with many of the specifics in the post, but found the core idea of a hacktivist game exciting. In the following sections I will define hacktivism, procedural rhetoric and metalepsis, and using those definitions expand on the original idea of hacktivist games.

I. Hacktivism

Hacktivism is a term given to politically motivated instances of hacking. In <a href="http://thehacktivist.com/">What is Hacktivism</a> the hacker metac0m gives his definition as “Hacktivism: a policy of hacking, phreaking or creating technology to achieve a political or social goal.” This definition is rooted in the idea that hackers are not criminals, but explorers and creators of technology. One of the central tenets of hacking culture is that all information should be freely available and accessible. <a href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/2002/04/19/waging_peace_on_the_internet/ ">The goal for hackers </a>who subscribe to this ideal is the creation of technology that promotes free access to information, typically through the Internet.

<a href="http://www.counterpunch.org/assange11252006.html">The second computer worm </a>on record was a politically motivated, hacktivist action. Called “WANK”, an acronym for Worms Against Nuclear Killers, the worm was not subtle. It modified the login screens of NASA and Department of Energy computers to display the anti-nuclear message: “You talk of times of peace for all, and then prepare for war.” The creator(s) of WANK seem to have perpetrated digital graffiti rather than a true hijacking of the infected system. Easy to spot, <a href="http://www.cert.org/advisories/CA-1989-04.htm">techniques were quickly drawn up</a> for removal, and it is doubtful the worm had any significant impact.
The use of computer networks for activist organization is older than the World Wide Web. Metac0m summarizes Stephan Wray saying: “the creation of PeaceNet, a text-based newsgroup service, in 1986 allowed 'political activists to communicate with one another across international borders with relative ease and speed.'" Since then, the Internet has played a role in organizing activism in Seattle, Iran, Tunisia, and Egypt, among other places. The use of the Internet as an organizing tool is not strictly hacktivism though, as it does not create anything new, and is not the final activist action. It is more analogous to using a telephone tree or fax machine to organize a protest which will occur somewhere in a real street.
Distributed Denial of Service attacks are one of the most commonly cited examples of hacktivism. The methods used to carry out a DDoS attack may vary, but the intent is to shut down a targeted server, usually flooding it with requests for information. Typically DDoS attacks are carried out by botnets of computers infected with spyware. A recent example of politically motivated DDoS-ing was carried out by the hacker group “Anonymous” in <a href="http://www.csmonitor.com/USA/2010/1209/How-pro-WikiLeaks-hackers-wage-cyberwar-without-hijacking-your-computer">retaliation for Mastercard stopping donations </a>to the organization WikiLeaks.
DDoS attacks have been compared to digital sit-ins, but this is off the mark, ignoring the relative social risks involved. <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/2011/jan/25/net-activism-delusion">Cory Doctorow writes</a> “As a tactic, DDoS has more in common with filling a business's locks with super glue, or cutting its phone lines – risky, to be sure, but closer to vandalism and thus less apt to convince your neighbours to look sympathetically on your cause.” The name “Anonymous” embodies the difference. While a sit-in demonstrates that every member of the protest is committed enough to be arrested for their cause, DDoS attacks just show that someone somewhere is committed enough to infect other people's computers for a cause.

Anonymous does not carry out their DDoS attacks exclusively through spyware infected botnets. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LOIC">The Low Orbit Ion Cannon</a> is a program that allows users to voluntarily join a botnet. The controller of this volunteer botnet can then DDoS a server of their choice. The people involved voluntarily use their computer's processing power and bandwidth to carry out the attack rather than being infected by a virus.
This program addresses some of the difficulties of DDoS as a hacktivist technique, but not all. First, the scale of users is not enough to knock out most servers, even if they were <a href="http://www.networkworld.com/news/2010/121010-wikileaks-ddos-tool-downloads-grow.html">all targeted at the same IP.</a> Secondly, after signing on the user has no influence over how the attack proceeds. Most importantly though, these attacks categorically work against the hacker ethic of open and free information by closing off all access to the target site. Hacktivist Oxblood Ruffin, quoted in What is Hacktivism states: “Hackers should promote the free flow of information, and causing anything to disrupt, prevent, or retard that flow is improper. ” He goes on to criticize DDoS as “an assault on free speech”.

II. Procedural Rhetoric and Meaningful Games

The term “procedural rhetoric” is defined by Ian Bogost as “a practice of using processes persuasively” (Bogost, 3). Bogost expands on this basic idea throughout his seminal book, Persuasive Games. Using examples from his own game studio, also called Persuasive Games, and others, Bogost builds the case that processes have the ability to make persuasive arguments. They do this “through the authorship of rules of behavior, the construction of dynamic models” (Bogost 29).

The basis of procedural rhetoric is that, when constructing an algorithmic model of another system, one which typically has a basis in the real world, the author of the model system makes statements about the modeled system. The “reader” of the model can then construct meaning from their experience of the model and apply that to their relationship with the modeled system. In games, this concept has been called “dynamical meaning” by Jon Blow (Bissell, 93). Dynamic meaning can be extracted from any model system, a category that games almost always fall into. Procedural rhetoric then, is the conscious management of a game's dynamic meaning in order to persuade the audience.
The ability to construct meaning from a system becomes difficult, if not impossible, if the system is sufficiently abstracted away from reality. Perhaps the most famous example is Janet Murray's reading of Tetris as a metaphor for Cold War era anxiety over work. Critics, such as Marku Eskelinen, have argued convincingly that this is an inaccurate analysis of a simple puzzle game. <a href="http://gamestudies.org/0101/eskelinen/">Eskelinen states:</a> “Instead of studying the actual game Murray tries to interpret its supposed content, or better yet, project her favourite content on it; consequently we don't learn anything of the features that make Tetris a game.” This illustrates one of the clear challenges in understanding the meaning of games. Games have a dynamic meaning arising from it's mechanics and the interaction of the player, but they also may have a representational layer that may include the graphics and story of the game. In addition, many games have representational and dynamic layers which contradict each other, as Blow explores in his lecture <a href="http://gamedesign.umwblogs.org/2011/03/10/conflicts-in-game-design/ ">Challenges in Game Design.</a>
In his dissertation Play the Message, Gonzalo Frasca presents a view of games that attempts to account for the multiple layers that convey meaning in a game. Previous studies of procedural rhetoric have focused mainly on the mechanics of a game. Frasca's dissertation is focused on play, the human interaction with a game, as much as it is with games as systems and adds this new dimension to the study of procedural rhetoric in games. His layers of a game are: playformance, mechanics, and playworld (Frasca, 91).
Mechanics is the rules based layer, and is equivalent to a compression of the MDA framework's <a href="http://gamedesign.umwblogs.org/2011/01/29/mda-framework-and-games-as-art/">Mechanics and Dynamics layers</a>. Frasca defines the playworld as “the activity's materiality: its objects, space and time. ” This corresponds roughly to the Aesthetics of MDA, and is where the representational aspects of games appear. Frasca's most interesting category is what he calls playformance. An essential element in games is the possible actions the human player is allowed by the mechanical layer of the game. Frasca argues that the way in which the player plays is as significant as the mechanical or representational layers, and forms of playing are critical to constructing meaning (Frasca, 139). The academic consequence of playformance is that, in order to study a game effectively, it must be experienced. Frasca illustrates this with an amusing anecdote involving the difference between reading the rules of and playing a kissing game (Frasca, 171).
While formalized procedural rhetoric is a relatively new concept, Frasca shows that games have long been used to persuasively model real world systems. Frasca explores the history of the popular board game Monopoly, a game originally designed by Lizzie Magie Phillips (1904) as The Landlord's Game. Phillips stated that: “The object of the game is not only to afford amusement to the players, but to illustrate to them how... the landlord has an advantage over other enterprises and also how the single tax would discourage land speculation ” (Phillips qtd. in Frasca, 100) This game was intended as a dramatization of Phillips political beliefs, but repackaged as Monopoly the game was received very differently by it's depression era audience, as a fantasy of escape from their impoverished lives (Frasca, 101). This misinterpretation illustrates a challenge that persuasive games share with other forms of rhetoric, namely being consumed by an unintended, uninformed audience.

III. Metalepsis

In the final chapter of her book Avatars of Story, Marie-Laure Ryan convincingly demonstrates that the narrative figure of metalepsis is a useful tool for the study of video games, and indeed computers in general. Ryan uses the metaphor of the stack to conceptualize complex narratives where the initial story generates another story (Ryan, 204).
The stack is one of the fundamental computer data structures. Its main distinction is the “Last in, first out” functionality for storing and retrieving data. In a LIFO system, the newest item added will be the first removed if the remove function is called. Ryan notes that every story telling act “involves at least two levels: a real-world level, on which an author communicates with a reader, and a primary fictional level, on which a narrator communicates with a narratee within an imaginary world” (Ryan, 204). On top of those levels, more stories may be added, told by a narrator that exists in the imaginary world.
Traditionally, framed stories such as The Canterbury Tales resolve themselves the same way a stack works, by completing the most recently told story and so on down the stack until the primary fictional level is finished. However, occasionally these levels may be broken through, as when the host interrupts Chaucer's telling of “The Tale of Sir Thopas”. The story is, thankfully, cut short before its resolution by the host, a character who does not exists on the same narrative level of the stack as “The Tale of Sir Thopas”. In this example, the stack conceptualization is particularly valid. The poet Chaucer existed on a real-world level, while the traveler Chaucer is a character existing in the primary fictional level. The different layers of the stack can have multiple instances of the variable “Chaucer”, each with differing properties.
This breaking through from one level of the narrative stack to another is metalepsis. Ryan defines two types of metalepsis, rhetorical and ontological (Ryan, 206). The rhetorical type is when something from a lower level of the stack pops up briefly through the current top in order to comment on a situation in the top level, such as breaking the fourth wall in a film. Ryan notes that metaleptic breaks are acceptable if they cross one border between stacks but crossing multiple borders is challenging for the reader. Ontological metalepsis “opens a passage between levels that results in their interpenetration” (Ryan, 207). This type is destructive to the narrative stack, and would occur when a character from one level of the stack actually enters the world of a different level, rather than simply referring to it.

In July of 2010, the virus that came to be known as <a href="http://www.symantec.com/security_response/writeup.jsp?docid=2010-071400-3123-99 ">“stuxnet” was discovered</a>. Stuxnet was remarkable for many reasons, including its impressive technical feats, level of sophistication, and the fact that it appeared to specifically target Iran's nuclear facilities. Among the many fascinating aspects of stuxnet, its targeting of the industrial control systems of the plant stuck out to me. Stuxnet was designed to break out of the “stack” of computer systems and inflict real-world damage by taking control of the plant. Though it is unclear how effectively stuxnet was able to carry out its goals given the secrecy surrounding Iran's nuclear program, I would classify it as a metaleptic computer program. Stuxnet may not have been the first to do this, but it is certainly the most well known. It also appears to have inspired other attackers to <a href="http://www.v3.co.uk/v3-uk/news/2045556/stuxnet-attacks-beckon-scada-threats-discovered">target similar systems.</a>

IV. Hacktivist Games

These sections lead to the main proposal of this paper, the potential for hacktivist video games. A hacktivist video game would procedurally enact its argument in a game form, while having a direct computational or real world impact that carries out that argument. A hacktivist game would lower the barrier of technical skill for activists interested in aiding a cause. It could artistically and intellectually engage its participants while simultaneously politically engaging them.

A hacktivist video game would be as much a work of art as any other carefully crafted video game. This fact, combined with the game's direct impact, would be a unique form of protest art that not only aims to convince the audience of its argument, but also to politically engage them in working towards a realization of the cause. The goal of such a game would be to have some direct impact rather than an indirect one carried out by its players.

One motivation for creating a hacktivist game would be to engage and empower a larger number of people in hacktivist causes. The sort of hacktivism that creates new technology to promote freedom, as explored in section I, has a very high level of technical skill associated with it. This is very much contradictory to traditional forms of mass activism.
For example, the most famous “hacktivist” groups currently active are Anonymous and Wikileaks. Some may dispute their classification as hacktivist, but for most of the general public these two groups are the face of politically motivated hacking. Both groups are comprised of a secretive, small, elite leadership, which is impenetrable to other people who wish to help further their causes. This is directly opposed to the tactics of social or political movements in the 20th century. Ground breaking community organizer Saul Alinksy once said that there are two source of power, mass money and mass people, and social movements only have access to the latter.

This concentration of power in the hands of the few is not only an impediment to freedom, it exposes the entire “organization” to great risk if those few are removed. Of course, a hacktivist game would not solve all of the structural problems in hacktivist organizations. Hopefully, by distributing the political task to a wide network of activists they could reduce risk of outside interference halting their political action.
One application of a hacktivist game would be an interface for performing what <a href="https://www.mturk.com/mturk/welcome">Amazon's  Mechanical Turk</a> calls “Human Intelligence Tasks”. These are tasks that are performed by humans, but evaluated in aggregate by a computer program. The name “<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Turk">Mechanical Turk</a>” comes from a famous chess playing machine of the 18th century. The “machine” beat chess players across Europe, but was actually a clever ruse. A chess master hid inside the base of the Turk and played the game, secretly controlling the machine.
The ludic origin of that name aside, the concept of humans game play having computational impact is well known. <a href="http://images.google.com/imagelabeler/">Google's Image Labeler</a> takes the form of a simple game in which players attempt to tag a series of shared images with the same tag. The catch is, it must be a word which this image has not been tagged with yet. Humans are able to analyze the images differently than a computer algorithm would be able to. A hacktivist may have a challenge which is easier solved by having a mass amount of players solve little pieces of the problem and return the results to a central computer program. In such a case, a carefully crafted hacktivist game would suit their purposes.

V. Current Games which are similar

To my knowledge there is no game that I would consider hacktivist. There are however several games that attempt to address similar challenges.<a href="http://www.molleindustria.org/leakyworld/leakyworld.html"> Leaky World: a playable theory</a> by Molleindustria, and <a href="http://www.stfj.net/index2.php?project=art/2009/loselose">Lose/Lose</a> by Zach Gage will be the examples I explore in this paper.
Leaky World was designed by Molleindustria for the <a href="http://wikileaks-stories.com/">Wikileaks-Stories</a> project. Like Molleindustria's other projects, Leaky World has a clear political intent, and even engages with tangentially hacktivist content. However, as the subtitle “a playable theory” implies, this is a game that explores Paulo Pedercini's reaction to and understanding of Julian Assange's essay “Conspiracy as Governance”. The game has consequences in the mind and opinions of its players, but none that are direct, either computationally or in the real world. It was not intended to be a hacktivist video game, so this is not a criticism.
In the game, you control a growing line which you use to connect dots on the world map. There is a timer in the upper right that represents accumulating leaks. If too many links are connected to a single node, it grows white and begins “leaking”, filling up the bottom of the window with white froth. To resolve this before you are flooded away, holding space can cut links. What results is a dynamic of trying to connect the whole world, but constantly having to race back across the map to sever the links you made a few seconds earlier.
Purely as a game, Leaky World is boring. Spooky music and vague text do not automatically induce deep intellectual engagement. However, the bottom of the page contains the full text of Assange's essay, as well as Pedercini's criticisms. The game is a direct embodiment of Assange's section “Terrorist conspiracies as connected graphs”, except made in software instead of nails and twine. The game is also extremely difficult to win. The fact that the links you create are also your downfall is a clever mechanic that raises tension, and is an interesting idea in the context of Assange's essay.
I think that more engagement with the leaks themselves offers an opportunity for a hacktivist type game.<a href="www.cablegategame.com"> Cablegate: The Game</a> does so with a tagging system similar to the Google Image Labeler. This type of game immerses its players in the leaks themselves, and then presents the results of their play to the public, in this case as tags and summaries of the leaks. It would not be much of a stretch to imagine an algorithm that uses those results to further analyze and dissect the vast amount of information available in all of the various leaked cables.
Lose/Lose was developed by Zach Gage <a href="http://news.cnet.com/8301-27080_3-10391185-245.html?tag=newsEditorsPicksArea.0">as part of his MFA</a>. It is interesting because, while not as explicitly political as A Leaky World, its procedural rhetoric has more direct consequences. The core of the game is a basic shoot em up, with the twist that the enemies on your screen are files on your hard drive. Killing them will result in their actual deletion from your computer. In a statement about the game on his website Gage writes “Why do we assume that because we are given a weapon an awarded for using it, that doing so is right?” and continues on to ask “At what point does our virtual data become as important to us as physical possessions?”. These are powerful questions which Lose/Lose raises mostly through its existence.
I will admit that, despite Frasca's advice to play the game you are studying, I have not personally played through Lose/Lose. I have no desire to delete random files from my own computer. Having watched several videos of the game being played, I feel like I understand it. The game opens with a big red warning that this game will delete real data from your hard drive, which is a sobering counterpoint to the pure, visceral fun of the shmup interface. The core argument of the game seems to be, “think before you shoot”, and it carries this out by giving very real, direct consequences for playing.
This is not a hacktivist game simply because it has no broader activist purpose. With some modification, it could become one. In fact,  <a href="http://www.symantec.com/connect/blogs/osxloosemaque-it-s-not-just-game-anymore">Symantec classifies it as a virus</a> because of this potential for modification. Symantec's Kevin Haley (qtd. in Cnet) amusingly said, “I don't see the positive aspect of it, but I suppose if it's art we're not supposed to completely understand it.”
