title: Procedurality and Play
date: 01/01/2012

In the new edition of [*Game Studies*](http://gamestudies.org/), [Miguel Sicart](www.miguelsicart.net) wrote an intentionally provactive piece [*Against Procedurality*](http://gamestudies.org/1103/articles/sicart_ap), which attempts to poke a stick at the idea of procedural rhetoric and its centrality to academic discourse about video games.

He begins with a historical overview of the emergence of procedurality as the dominant conceptual framework in game studies.
##FINISH OVERVIEW yO

I think that Gonzalo Frasca's dissertation [*Play the Message*](http://www.ludology.org/2011/03/frascaplaythemessage.html) offers a compelling framework to begin thinking about the player's vital role in crafting meaning from games.

I think one simple reason that less attention has been given to the role of play is that it is difficult to describe.
Frasca quotes play scholar Brian Sutton Smith on play:
> We all play occasionally, and we all know what playing feels like. But when it comes to making theoretical statements about what play is, we fall into silliness.

Rules are by their nature much more concrete, and can be written about with more certainty.
Through [critical code readings](/2011/10/06/critical-code-studies-paper-proposal/) scholars can see the very specific way in which games are formed.
Code is textual, and even non-digital games have written rulesets.
These texts can be quoted, cited, and included in your thesis.
What's the MLA citation for "The feeling I had when I played *Passage*", or "The pleasure clicking that cow gave me".
This might be an oversimplification, but lengthy explanations of your personal play experience seem vulnerable to long winded self indulgence that reveals more about the player than the game.
