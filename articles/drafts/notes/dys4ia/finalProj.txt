Dys4ia

Open with Dys4ia, will use it to explore procedurality in games vs player experience
Two goals: expand my analysis of Dys4ia, and develop a methodology for studying player experience in games, then compare the insights gained from player experience vs procedural rhetoric

Notes:
  
  Against Procedurality - Miguel Sicart
    Sicart considers the prevailing proceduralist school, as typified by Bogost, an incomplete account of meaning in games.
    "The importance of procedurality in games studies cannot be denied."
    "For each procedural analysis there must be an orthogonal analysis of play that completes the arguments of meaning by means of accounting the play experience."
    

  The Meaning of Video Games - Steven E. Jones
    (9) "A video game...is a system designed such that it only fulfills it [sic] potential for meaning when its specific technical features...are expressed as the game makes its way out into the world, when it's played."
    (101) Context: A player experiencing facade for the first time saying "'What the hell is this?' It was just so outside his expectations about what you do in a game, that he didn't even know how to think about the experience."
      -Anthropy, placing the game in the context of Newgrounds is an important rhetorical move, beyond the procedurality of the game
        -Rather than downloading and playing alone, you immediately see other people's reactions in the comment thread
        -Confronts the academic/art game researcher interested in her work who on newgrounds can also find infantile (example, example, example)
        -And confronts the newgrounds audience, who are not typically thought of as welcoming or progressively minded...
      In the same section: Discussion of whether Facade is a game or not. Applies to Dys4ia as well, but is pointless.

  Play the Message - Gonzalo Frasca

    Frasca's Framework: (91)
      Playformance- The act of the player playing
      Mechanics- The rules of the activity (game)
      Playworld- The space and time of the activity
    

    -Play is difficult to define
      Brian Sutton-Smith:
      "We all play occasionally, and we all know what playing feels like. But when it comes to making theoretical statements about what play is, we fall into silliness" -From The Ambiguity of Play, qtd in Frasca (35)

"A system-centric approach to games can also lead to unjustly fetishizing rules over player performance." (65) Pair w/ quotes from Sicart
  Dys4ia lends clarity to its rule-based arguments, by creating very small, very tightly focused systems.
  By limiting the players' interactions, Anthropy is able to focus their attention on the few rules available.
  Dys4ia achieves depth by rapidly sequencing these vignettes, providing a large number of rulesets, which are relatively shallow individually.
  This structure decreases the time between the aporia/epiphany (To reduce player frustration) which can increase player confusion.
  The game continues, whether or not the player has addressed their simulation fever.
    -EXPAND ON THIS!
  
      -Along that line, "player experience" is nebulous and inherently subjective
        -My experience as a straight male was typically confusion and discomfort (Which, in certain cases were intentionally designed experiences, but others (SPECIFIC) were possibly not?)
        -Trans-folks experience (From online comments) was one of comfort and solidarity
        -Gamers from Newgrounds experience was confusion and possibly rejection
