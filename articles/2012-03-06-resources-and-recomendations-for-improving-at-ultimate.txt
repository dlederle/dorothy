title: Resources and Recomendations for Improving at Ultimate
date: 06/03/2012
category: Ultimate

I play Ultimate Frisbee, and its one of the things that I read and think about a lot. 
I am not qualified to write about high level Ultimate.
I am not an experienced player. 
I have no world, national, or regional titles on my resume.
However, I do think that I'm qualified to talk about how to improve your game.
As a Freshman, I was absolutely *awful*, and I've worked pretty hard to make my way up to merely mediocre.
Heres my very long, rambling list of recommendations for how to improve your skillz.
Follow along, and you too can aspire to mediocrity.

##First Things First

*Quick Note:* This whole post is targeted at my college team specifically, though other upcoming college players may find it useful.
If you are an absolute beginner or a club veteran this will probably be less helpful.

First, inspire yourself with [this video.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6wDvuBTj8Vk&feature=player_embedded)

Now, you are probably not that good.
If you are, stop reading this, you'll just tell me how wrong I am about everything.
Watching highlights is fun and inspiring, but isn't the best way to actually improve your game.
Trying to emulate those plays without some preparation and you'll probably look like a fool, turn it over, or injure yourself.
So, how can we build toward becoming a dominant, awe inspiring player?
Or at least turn it over less.

##Throws

<br />
<br />

###Basics

The first thing to do is master the basic throws.
The best resource for this I know of is Brodie Smith's Bro-Tips series on youtube.
The first one is [How to Throw a Backhand](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mlf7nfKYK40&feature=relmfu) and the series continues through more advanced throws and techniques.
Watch them, but don't just watch them and then go back to browsing reddit or facebook.
You'll get the most out of these videos if you and a buddy watch them, then go throw with focus.
Focus on your own throws, but also critique your friend's.
It's easy to see what a good thrower looks like by watching video, but comparing your own motions to those throwers can be difficult.

###Practice and Mastery

Especially when you are first learning to throw, daily practice cannot be beaten.
Remember, I started this by saying I had never really won anything of note in Ultimate?
Well, Ben Wiggins is sort of the opposite of that.
He's won everything.
[And he says you should try to throw every day.](http://skydmagazine.com/2011/11/wiggins-zen-throwing-routine/)

If you don't trust him, I have personal anecdotal evidence to back that up.
I spent two years throwing a lot (by the standards of our team) but not every day.
I got my throws to stop turfing, and was even handling a little.
But forehand hucks eluded me.
I completely reworked my technique three or four times, but just could not throw far.
This month, I decided to take Wiggins seriously and make a conscious effort to throw daily.
Lo and behold, I have a semi-respectable forehand huck that I am now working to perfect.

Attending team practices *will not* make you a good thrower, the work you do before practice and on off days will.
We will run some throwing drills to make everyone competent, but we would prefer to utilize our limited field time to run more full team drills.
To advance as a thrower, you *need* to work outside of practice.

So, now that you believe daily throwing is important, the question is how to practice.
If you didn't already, read [Wiggins Zen Throwing Routine.](http://skydmagazine.com/2011/11/wiggins-zen-throwing-routine/)
Here's the key to getting better:

> Iâ€™ll just end by saying that no routine or doctrine can ever take the place of the most fundamental throwing skill. That skill is in making every practice throw as game-like as possible, both mentally and physically.

It isn't volume of throwing, it is quality of deliberate, daily practice.
Standing in a circle and throwing dumb lefties while you chat with friends is fun, and I'm not saying don't do that.
But if that is your idea of a throwing practice, you will never get better.

It's linked from that article, but here is another throwing routine if you have a longer time to throw.
[Kung Fu Throwing](http://winthefields.blogspot.com/2011/07/kung-fu-throwing.html) from Lou Burruss, another one of those players who has an impressive Ultimate resume both coaching and playing (In other words, you should listen to him).

##Offense

So, let me pretend that my ideal reader is now progressing on their throws, with focused daily practice.
You now want to get back on the field.
Here are some thoughts from different places on improving your offense skill set.

###Cutting

Statistically you probably play mostly as a cutter.
The best advice Andrew Dickerson gave me as a younger player (it was actually directed at Ross, but I was listening) was to stop thinking of the game in terms of throws, and start thinking of it in terms of space and timing.
Offense is creating and attacking space.
Defense is trying to take away space.
Since this is about offense and cutting, lets look at what cutters can do to create and exploit space.

Matt Mackey is another Ultimate blogger.
I really enjoy the backlog of his blog because he started writing while still a young college player.
He used to write a ton, and you can follow along as his thoughts on the game emerge.
Rather than offering proven routines and programs like Wiggins or Burruss, Mackey raises more questions than conclusions (and then eventually does give an answer, but maybe not for another year of thought provoking posts).

Oh look, turns out he has an [entire series](http://www.ultimatethoughts.com/category/offense/cutting) on "cutting thoughts."
Here's a [good starting point](http://www.ultimatethoughts.com/2008/06/cutting-thought-create-space.html) where he repeats the creating and attacking space idea (I guess Andrew reads this blog too).
In this article he discusses creating space for your own cut, but creating space for teammate's cuts is just as important.

**Personal Digression**
If you remember any tournaments, our offense would occasionally have two opposite, but related, problems with our cutting.
At times nobody would move and the handlers would yell about lazy cutters, before doing something stupid and turning it over.
At other times, all four cutters would decide to run to exactly the same place on the field.
Then the handlers would yell about stupid cutters, before doing something stupid and turning it over.
This is not a problem unique to our team.
It's a timing problem.

Timing your cuts can be one of the most difficult things for new players to learn because those two extremes of stagnation and over cutting are intimidating.
Adding to the challenge, "good timing" varies a lot depending on the offensive system, the particular skills of the players on the field, the weather, the emotional tenor of the game, and probably other factors I can't quantify right now.
Mackey offers [this](http://www.ultimatethoughts.com/2009/05/building-the-repetoire-thought-guiding-tools.html) on decision making, which will impact your timing.
[This article](http://www.ultimatethoughts.com/2008/07/cutting-thought-a-mind-for-adjustments.html) also offers some entry points to refine your timing and cutting choices.

OK, so now we know where to go on the field and when we want to get there.
Next comes the much simpler task of getting there.
Now, [cutting requires athleticism](http://www.ultimatethoughts.com/2008/06/cutting-thought-be-fit.html).
"Duh" you slower players say, "How does that help me?"
While blazing speed is obviously useful when cutting, you can still be effective with a low level of speed (How slow depends on how fast the people defending you are. If you want to play at Club Nationals you need to be a little faster than you will if your goal is to compete at the DIII College level).
You need to force the defender into giving you the space you want.
Again, [Mackey has a post on this.](http://www.ultimatethoughts.com/2007/11/cutting-threat-points.html)
Give the defender two options, and then take the one they leave you with. 
Unless you are VERY physically outmatched, it is unlikely a defender can take away all of your options.
However, a good defender will take away all of your options for the three seconds where you could have gotten the disc in a dangerous position.

My final piece of advice is to be decisive.
As [this post says:](http://ultfris.blogspot.com/2004/12/fundamentals-of-man-defense.html) 

> The offensive advantage in ultimate is often described using the metaphor of a two person race in which the offensive player decides the starting time and the ending point.

Don't hesitate, just pick where you want to get the disc and go there hard.
You'll be surprised at how often you can shred faster, more athletic defenders.

###Handling

I've spent the last year trying to become a dominant handler, and I am no where near that goal, but I can share some of the things I'm working on and how I'm working on them.

The first thing people know about handlers is they're the ones that can throw.
This is true, but more importantly I think is that they're the ones who know what NOT to throw.
The role of the handlers varies depending on the system your playing in, but it almost always involves controlling the pace of the offense and making decisions that will result in a high probability of scoring and a low probability of turning the over disc.

Every article you read about the strategic side of ultimate will help you out, look through the archives of these blogs I'm linking all over the place.
But that isn't going to allow you to implement those strategies.
Visualization helps, as does drawing out X/O diagrams for situations you may face.
The number one thing is simple experience though, as frustrating as that seems.

Make lots of mistakes (in practice please) and reflect on what you did wrong.
If you aren't sure, ask someone you respect who was watching.
Everybody loves telling you how dumb that decision was, and arguing about it is often a helpful way of crystallizing just how wrong that decision was.

There are of course particular skills that a handler needs beyond the mental and strategic.
If you can't get open on the dump every time, work on your footwork and your ability to accelerate and decelerate.
You need to be confident in a wide variety of throws, although I believe you can be a very effective handler with just a couple throws perfected, rather than  dozen wobbly upside variations.
You also do need to know your own throws, know how to [tell if they're off that day](http://www.ultimatethoughts.com/2008/10/throwing-thought-develop-a-checklist.html), and know how to fix them.

##Defense

Defense is difficult in Ultimate.
It is also a huge topic of writing among the Ultimate blogs.
Thinking about the slight tweaks in your defense that could shut down your regional rivals is pretty fun actually (I'm a nerd).
However, we aren't playing with X/O's, we are playing with a set roster of around 20 guys, who have limits on their talent and athleticism.
The best thing we can do is not learn another complex junk defense, which 6 players run correctly, only to have the 7th out of position while they score easily.
Every player on the team needs to have solid defensive fundamentals before we can getting [fancy.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZTHCInxt8o)

###Man Defense

I already linked to [this article](http://ultfris.blogspot.com/2004/12/fundamentals-of-man-defense.html) but I know you lazy bums didn't read it.
You probably already know most of that stuff if you paid any attention practice.
"Knowing it" and being able to execute it are two different things though.
I think there are several levels of man D fundamentals you need to get through before you are really proficient.

Level 1, The Chase:

This is where everybody starts.
You follow your man around the field, and put on the mark when he gets the disc, maybe even forcing the right way.
This is not very effective unless you have crazy closing speed after the disc is in the air.
Players at this level are constantly surprised by their cutter's movements, and react with varying speeds.

Level 2, The Island:

One of Austin's favorite phrases was to be "on an island with your man".
This means just be close to them all the time.
It's basically the same thing as the chase, but now you're completely focussed on your man without the distractions of the rest of the game.
If you are athletic enough to keep up with everyone you ever guard, then just trying to be close to them will shut them down.
You are not that athletic.

Level 3, Get Physical:

Most players (This may only be true of male players, I have little co-ed experience, sorry) then reach a stage where the shouts of "Dictate!" from the sideline pierce their skulls, so they decide to put their body on the cutter.
This is a lot more effective, and can disrupt a lot of cutters.
However, you still react, and if the cutter is smart they will force you off balance and exploit the fraction of a second where you can't catch up.

Level 4, Smarter, not harder:

At this point you have the physical ability to keep up with most cutters, and the footwork to maintain your balance.
What distinguishes you now is your ability to keep track of your man, the disc, and the other players on the field.
You constantly adjust your positioning to take away their biggest threat, and have the awareness to "jump routes" when the cutter is being predictable.
You are frustrating to play against.

This is where my level of ability maxes out.
There are probably advanced techniques to individual man D that get you better, but I am not there yet.

Level 100, Wiley Old Guy:

If you play in a rec league or certain pickups you know this type of D.
Unable to run anymore, but with more experience playing Ultimate than you have doing anything, these guys seem easy to cut against.
Then they materialize out of nowhere holding the disc that was supposed to go to you.
Their poaching works best against less experienced players, but that's you so watch out.
Don't make the mistake of trying to play like this, unless your team as a whole can cover your back.
You are not as experienced as they are so you won't do it right, and it doesn't actually work against good players.

*Other Notes on Man D:*

These were all written with the perspective of playing against downfield cutters, but the same principles apply against handlers.
You just need even tighter footwork, and max speed becomes less important than reaction time and explosiveness.

I think one of the most important skills a defender can develop is the ability to read their opponent.
If you realize you are playing against an absolute rookie, your goal should be complete shutdown.
Against truly good cutters it can be nearly impossible for one player to shut them down.
At this point you should work to contain them, only allowing them to get the disc in positions where they have limited continuation options.
The other aspect of Man D is [help D and switching.](http://the-huddle.org/issues/13/)
The key is communication and trusting your team mates.

Oh, and [marking](http://www.the-huddle.org/issues/25/) is [really important](http://www.ultimatethoughts.com/category/defense/marking) to.
Read those articles from more players who are far better than I am.

###Zone

I refer you to the introduction to this defense section.
Zone's are tricky, and fun to think up little tweaks to.
Since I wrote so much about Man D, I'll leave this a bit more sparse.

If ultimate is all about space and timing, a good zone's job is to radically change the space in a way that the opponent hopefully doesn't understand until they have already turned the disc over.
I'd encourage you to read about different [types of zones](http://ultfris.blogspot.com/2005/04/woods-theory-of-zone-defense-part-1-b.html), [different philosophies](http://www.the-huddle.org/issues/7/), and think about how different situations call for different zones.

##Watching Video

I started by saying that watching [highlights](http://vimeo.com/24059285) is not the best way to improve.
In contrast, watching full video is great for thinking about the game in different ways.
Try rewinding the same point a few times and watching for different things.
The first time through, watch as a fan, following the disc to see who wins.
The second time, watch for the offense, the third the defense.
Don't do that for every point of course, but think critically about how you would stop a particular tactic.
Also, try picking out a single player who plays a similar position you, or who has a skill you want to learn.
Then copy the things they do well, and think of better ways to do the things they can't do well.

And video link dump:

[Skyd Magazine Youtube:](http://www.youtube.com/user/skydmagazine?ob=0&feature=results_main)
You can ignore the interviews, but there are several full games on there.
[Colorado vs Pitt](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uk_9tpTpLdk&feature=plcp&context=C3b83eb5UDOEgsToPDskIiWaMCF3osFGkLk8XWxJ8l) from last years College Championships is particularly good.

[Disc Videos:](http://www.discvideos.com/)
Mostly highlights, but some full games.
The highlights are also impressive.
I wanna be [that beard guy.](http://www.discvideos.com/oregon-ultimate-2009-trouble-in-vegas/)

[Ultivillage:](http://www.ultivillage.com/)
Full length games are not free, but good quality from what I've seen. They also have free clips that are usually a point or two long.

[NexGenNetworks:](https://www.ngnultimate.com/)
NGN is trying to do live coverage of the bigger college tournaments.
So far the first one they did was fantastic, and I hope they put up some archives soon.

##In Closing

There's a lot to learn, but it doesn't really matter unless you use it.
Focused practice, with continual goal-setting and honest self assessment is the way to get better at just about anything.

Oh, and that World Champion Ben Wiggins already wrote a [much more concise and insightful series](http://skydmagazine.com/2012/01/raise-your-game-day-1/) of how to get better.
You should probably listen to him.
