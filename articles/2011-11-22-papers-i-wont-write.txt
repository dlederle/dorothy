title: Paper's I won't write
date: 22/11/2011
category: abstract

Introducing a [new section](http://blog.dlederle.com/abstracts) on my infant blog.
Abstracts for papers I (probably) won't write.
Sometimes I have ideas for papers I'd like to research and write up, but they almost always end up as scribbles in the marginalia of a math notebook.
I'm going to try to write down and collect them from now on.

I'll see if I can go back and explore some of them more fully later on.
If I do, I'll be sure to link to them in the original posts.
